id(): returns the identity of an object

    -> the id must be guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime

        -> the id of the object may be different each time you run the program, but while your program's running,
        the object will have the same id

    -> eg:

        result = True
        another_result = result
        print(id(result))
        print(id(another_result))
