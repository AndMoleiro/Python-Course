- check variable type -> use type() function

    Eg: print(type(greeting))

        --> <class 'str'>

Numeric data types:

 - int: whole numbers (no fractional part)

    - can be considered just special cases of real numbers.

    - when represented in a computer, computations using integers are significantly faster than using floating point numbers

    - the python int has no maximum size


 - float: real numbers (having a fractional part after the decimal point)

    - Eg: 1.0, 123.456...

    - Python floats have 52 digits of precision. If you need more precise decimal numbers, python 3 includes a decimal data type.


 - complex: contain a real and an imaginary part, based on the square root of minus one
