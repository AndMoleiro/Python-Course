- for Loop:
    - it assigns each of the values, one by one, to one or more variables.
    - It then executes a block of code once for each value

        - the set of values comes from a sequence, or some other iterable object

            - an iterable object is anything that can be iterated over.

          eg:

            parrot = "Norwegian Blue"

            for character in parrot:
                print(character)
