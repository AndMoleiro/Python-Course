- for Loop:
    - it assigns each of the values, one by one, to one or more variables.
    - It then executes a block of code once for each value

        - the set of values comes from a sequence, or some other iterable object

            - an iterable object is anything that can be iterated over.

          eg:

            parrot = "Norwegian Blue"

            for character in parrot:
                print(character)

- iterable types

    - range:

        eg:

        for i in range(1, 3):
            print("i is now {}".format(i))

                --> 1,2

        - we can add a step to the range

            eg:

                for i in range(0, 100, 10):
                    print("i is now {}".format(i))

                        --> 10, 20, 30...

- nested for loops

    - a for loop nested within another for loop

        eg:

        for i in range(1, 1
            for j in range(
                print("{0}
            print("-" * 80)

                --> times tables (1 - 12)
