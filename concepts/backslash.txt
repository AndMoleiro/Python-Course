backslash can be used to:

    - split strings on different lines: \n

        Eg:

        splitString = "This string has been \nsplit over \nseveral \nlines"
        print (splitString)

            --> This string has been
                split over
                several
                lines


    - split strings with tabs: \t

        Eg:

        tabbedString = "1\t2\t3\t4\t5"
        print(tabbedString)

        --> 1	2	3	4	5


    - escape characters: \

        Eg 1:

        # string is encased in '' so we escape the apostrophe
        print('The pet shop owner said "No, no, \'e\'s uh,...he\'s resting".')

            --> The pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's uh, ...he's resting".


       Eg 2:

       # string is encased in "" so we escape the double quotes
       print("The pet shop owner said \"No, no, 'e's uh,...he's resting\".")

           --> The pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's uh, ...he's resting".


       Eg 3:

       #using """, lets you skip escaping "" or '
       print("""The pet shot owner said "No, no, 'e's uh,...he's resting".""")

            --> The pet shop owner said "No, no, 'e's uh, ...he's resting".


    - Using the backslash character: \

        Eg 1:

        #using double backslash (\\)
        print("C:\\Users\\timbuchalka\\notes.txt")

            --> C:\Users\timbuchalka\notes.txt


        Eg 2:

        #turning the string into a raw string (adding r)
        print(r"C:\Users\timbuchalka\notes.txt")

            --> C:\Users\timbuchalka\notes.txt
