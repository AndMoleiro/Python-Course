- if: adds a condition

    eg:
        if age >= 18:
            print("You are old enough to vote")


- else: adds a second output to a condition

    eg:
        if age >= 18:
            print("You are old enough to vote")
        else:
            print("Please come back in {0} years".format(18-age))


- elif: check conditions between if and else

    eg:

        if age < 18:
            print("Please come back in {0} years".format(18-age))
        elif age == 900:
            print("Sorry, Yoda, you die in Return of the Jedi")
        else:
            print("You are old enough to vote")
            print("Please put an X in the box")


- if Blocks: A block can be quite complex, including further if and else blocks

    - when testing for equality, we can't use a single = symbol:

        - = is used for assigning values to variables

        - == is used to test for equality

    - An if statement can include any elif parts, but there can only be one else. elif is short for "else if"
