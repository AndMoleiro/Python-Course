methods: a method is the same as a function, except it's bound to an object

    - that means we need an object in order to call a method.

    - when you call a function, you just type its name, and provide arguments in parentheses.

        - eg:

            len(even)

    - when we call a method, we tell it which object it's called

        - in other words, which object it should be using when it performs its funcion

            - eg:

                s.append(x)

                    -> means that we'll be appending x to a list called s

                    -> we pass x as an argument, so that the method knows what to append
